Story 

Once upon a time, mommy pig told her three pigs, you must go out and live by yourselves now that you have grown up. So the three pigs went to build a house. The oldest said, "Im going to build a house made out of straw to save time so I can get more time to play!"
The pig in the middle said 
"Im going to make a wood house because it is strong enough and can save some time so I can go play" While the older pigs were playing, the youngest pig was working hard on his brick house and ignored his brothers as they bugged for him to play with him.
Then when it was night, all the pigs went back to their homes. And after a while they could hear a wolf. The wolf came out looking for dinner and went to the oldest pigs house, and blew it down.
